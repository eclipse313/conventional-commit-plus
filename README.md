# Conventional-Commit Plus ‚ú®

üìò [**Specification**](#specification) - ü§ì [**Cheat-Sheet**](#cheat-sheet) - :octocat: [**Git Hooks**](#automatic-setup-with-git-hooks) - üöì [**Commitlint**](#specification)

Conventional-Commit Plus is a round-up of my accumulated knowledge on the subject of commits. The project is on the one hand a cheat sheet with all the information I have gathered on this topic and consider useful. On the other hand this is a package that can be used to configure Commitlint. The structure proposed here is a marriage of [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org) and [Gitmoji](https://gitmoji.dev/).

The following topics will be covered:

-   [General information about Conventional Commits](#about-conventional-commits)
-   [What is the benefit of Conventional Commits (Plus)?](#why-use-conventional-commits-in-general)
-   [The specifications of Conventional Commits Plus](#specification)
-   [Cheat-Sheet: available types for commits](#cheat-sheet) _‚Üê Probably you are looking for this_
-   [Automatic emojis with Git Hooks](#automatic-setup-with-git-hooks)
-   [Automatic linting with commitlint](#linting-with-commitlint)
-   [A few words in closing](concluding-remarks)

After following this guide, you may have **beautiful commit messages** in your repository that follow the well machine readable and widely used **Conventional Commits** but are still as **nice to look at** as Gitmoji. By using Git Hooks, you **won't incur any additional work** and commitlinter will ensure **high-quality commits across all contributors** and you can generate automatic changelogs or use semantic versioning:

## About Conventional Commits

The Conventional Commits specification is a lightweight convention on top of commit messages. It provides an easy set of rules for creating an explicit commit history; which makes it easier to write automated tools on top of. Check out [the specification](https://www.conventionalcommits.org) for more informations. Conventional commits, for example, make it easy to create automated changelogs.

Besides conventional commits, there are also other approaches and attempts to generalize commit messages and make them easier to understand. Another approach to classify commits is [Gitmoji](https://gitmoji.dev/). Here, instead of defined code words, emojis are used to categorize the commits.

Conventional commits define a certain structure of the commit message. An example of a commit using this structure might look like the following:

```
feat(api): allow provided config object to extend other configs
```

### Personal option and motivation

I believe that it makes sense and is necessary in larger projects to agree on a uniform standard of commits. Conventional commits are widely used and easily readable by machines due to their simple structure. Gitmoji rather follows the approach to design the commits in such a way that they are visually distinguished from each other by the emojis. Here I see the big disadvantage that the emojis look nice, but their meaning is not as clear - especially if you are not familiar with it - as the types of conventional commits.

For this reason, I decided to bring together what I consider the best of both worlds and create this repository.

## Why use Conventional Commits Plus

It is widely agreed that people can absorb information quickly, especially through visual stimuli.[^1] This is my motivation to extend conventional commits with emojis and to transfer this visual component into commits. Furthermore, the claim is not to violate any rules of conventional commits in order to maintain full support and backwards compatibility.

### Why use conventional commits in general?

The [specification](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#why-use-conventional-commits) of Conventional Commits summarizes the advantages nicely:

-   Making it easier for people to contribute to your projects, by allowing them to explore a more structured commit history.
-   Automatically generating CHANGELOGs.
-   Automatically determining a semantic version bump (based on the types of commits landed).
-   Communicating the nature of changes to teammates, the public, and other stakeholders.
-   Triggering build and publish processes.

## Specification

Conventional Commit Plus extends the original specification to the following commit message structure:

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description> <emoji>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

The [original specifications](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#specification) are retained and are expanded as follows:

-   The `emoji` MUST be present in every commit and MUST match the specified emoji of the type.

### Example

So a complete commit message could now look like this, for example:

```
fix(api): prevent racing of requests üêõ

Introduce a request id and a reference to latest request. Dismiss
incoming responses other than from latest request.

Remove timeouts which were used to mitigate the racing issue but are
obsolete now.

```

Examples of shorter messages might be:

```
docs: correct spelling of CHANGELOG üìö
```

```
feat(lang): add German language ‚ú®
```

#### Initial commit

According to Gitmoji I suggest to use `Initial commit üéâ` as message for the first commit in a new repository without specifying a type or further information.

## Automatic setup with Git Hooks

It is possible to automatically add the emoji to the commit message by using the unique relationship between `type` and emoji. So it is possible to write "normal" conversional commits and they will be adjusted automatically.

In the following a client-side Git Hook will be created which will automatically add the correct emoji to the commit-message depending on the `type`. A Git hook is a script that Git can run before or after certain events occur, such as committing changes or pushing code to a remote repository. Git Hooks allow developers to automate certain tasks, enforce coding standards, and perform checks to ensure that code meets quality and security requirements.

To set up the git hook, all you need to do is copy the `commit-msg` file (check out the [source code](commit-msg)) from this repository and put it in the .git/hooks folder of the project in question and give the file the necessary permissions to run automatically. This can be done by the following command when executed in the project folder:

```
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eclipse313/conventional-commit-plus/main/commit-msg -o .git/hooks/commit-msg
chmod +x .git/hooks/commit-msg
```

See this hook in action. Pay attention to the added emoji after the commit message based on its `type`:

![Git Hook autocompletes emoji](assets/img/git-hook-demo.gif)

## Linting with Commitlint

Commitlint is a tool that helps enforce consistent commit message formatting in Git repositories. It provides a set of rules that can be used to ensure that commit messages follow a specific pattern and format. This helps improve the readability of the commit history and makes it easier to understand the changes that have been made to a project over time.

The nice thing is: the commit format with the final emoji from this repository is backwards compatible with the default settings of commitlint. If you want to learn more about commitlint check out their [website](https://commitlint.js.org/#/).

It is possible to configure commitlint to check whether the format described in the specification is followed. To do this, you need to add this repository to your dev dependencies:

```
npm install --save-dev @eclipse313/conventional-commit-plus
```

Then you need to edit your commitlint configuration so that the `extends` array includes this repository:

```
// commitlint.config.js
module.exports = {
  extends: ['@eclipse313/conventional-commit-plus'],
};
```

After installation, three new rules are available and automatically activated:

-   **header-ends-with-emoji**: Checks if the header of the commit ends with an emoji.
-   **header-ends-with-allowed-emoji**: Checks if the header of the commit ends with one of the allowed emojis (see [types supported](#types-supported)).
-   **header-ends-with-matching-emoji**: Checks if the commit header ends with the emoji matching the type (see [types supported](#types-supported)).

See commitlint with this configuration in action:

![Commitlint checks](assets/img/commitlint.gif)

It is possible to disable and configure the rules as usual as described in the [commitlint documentation](https://commitlint.js.org/#/reference-rules):

```js
rules: {
	"header-ends-with-emoji": [2, "always"],
	"header-ends-with-allowed-emoji": [1, "always"], // Set this rule to "warning"
	"header-ends-with-matching-emoji": [0, "always"], // Disable this rule
}
```

## Concluding remarks

I didn't think anyone would read this far. If you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to open issues in the repository. I appreciate feedback and suggestions for improvement.
